## What is Penetration Testing
It is a type of testing focused on security. You assume the role of an attacker and try to compromise a system.

## Types of Penetration Testing
Whitebox - we can easily obtain all the information we need. The target system is cooperative.  
Graybox - we have few information that the target system is willing to give. The target system is reluctant.  
Blackbox - start from scratch. No information is being given voluntarily by the target system. The target system is indifferent.  

## Legal
Always check your local laws on what is legal to do. You usually need explicit permission to test a system.
