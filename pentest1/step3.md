You need to be familiar with Networking concepts to be able to be an efficient penetration tester. So if you are not yet familiar, stop now and learn Networking first.

Networking concepts will not be discussed and it is assumed that you have already used or will use that knowledge for discovery.

## Map the network of the system

Here we have different tools at our disposal. One is `traceroute`. The command takes in a hostname or an ip address. It will show the IP addresses of the routers it passes before it reaches a host.

`apt install -y traceroute`{{execute}}

`traceroute katacoda.com`{{execute}}

Another tool is whois. It can tell us about ownership and registration information of a domain.

`apt install -y whois`{{execute}}

`whois katacoda.com`{{execute}}

We can query the nameserver of a domain to know where it is hosted.

`dig ns katacoda.com`{{execute}}
